A quick-n-dirty tool to translate HTTP status codes to human readable descriptions, without leaving the terminal. Built out of necessity as I am working with RESTful APIs all day. Sometimes I get a weird response that I haven't seen before  - it's pain having to context-switch away from the terminal for such a small thing!

## Installation
You can install the tool with Go

```
go install github.com/kampanosg/whichsc@latest
```
