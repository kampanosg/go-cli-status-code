# whichsc 
[![Go](https://github.com/kampanosg/whichsc/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kampanosg/whichsc/actions/workflows/go.yml)

A quick-n-dirty tool to translate HTTP status codes to human-readable descriptions, without leaving the terminal. Built out of necessity - when working with RESTful APIs all day, the cost of switching away from the command line to look up an unknown code is just not worth it.

## Installation
You can install the tool with Go

```
go install github.com/kampanosg/whichsc@latest
```
