A quick-n-dirty tool to translate HTTP status codes to human readable descriptions, without leaving the terminal. Built out of necessity as I am working with RESTful APIs all day and sometimes I might get a weird response that I haven't seen before  - it's pain having to context-switch for such a small thing!

## Usage

### Executable
1. Download the latest release from Github
2. Unzip the executable
3. Move it in the folder that you keep all your programs (e.g: `/bin`)
4. Add an `alias`
5. You're done ðŸ¥³

### Build from source
1. Clone the project
2. Run `make build`
3. You can run the program with `./esc 418`
4. Optionally, you can add an alias to the executable
5. Ready to roll ðŸš€
