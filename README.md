A quick-n-dirty tool to translate HTTP status codes to human readable descriptions, without leaving the terminal. Built out of necessity as I am working with RESTful APIs all day and sometimes I might get a weird response that I haven't seen before  - it's pain having to context-switch for such a small thing!

2. Run `make build`
3. You can run the program with `./esc 418`
