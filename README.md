A quick-n-dirty tool to translate HTTP status codes to human readable descriptions, without leaving the terminal. Built out of necessity as I am working with RESTful APIs all day. Sometimes I get a weird response that I haven't seen before  - it's pain having to context-switch for such a small thing!

## Usage

### Build from source
1. Clone the project
2. Run `make` 
3. You can run the program with `esc 418`
4. Ready to roll üöÄ

‚ö†Ô∏è The installer moves the executable into `/usr/local/bin`. Update the `Makefile` if you want to change the installation path!
